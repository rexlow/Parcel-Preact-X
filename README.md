# Parcel Preact-X Boilerplate

I was consistently running into issues with the official `preact-cli` when upgrading to `preact-X`. Ergo, I have created a boilerplate to make my life easier. Feel free to use and pull requests are welcome!

## To Run

```
git clone https://github.com/rexlow/Parcel-Preact-X.git

cd Parcel-Preact-X && npm install

npm start
```
